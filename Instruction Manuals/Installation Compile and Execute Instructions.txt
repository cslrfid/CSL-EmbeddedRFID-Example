When installing in a CSL Intelligent Fixed Reader for the first time:

1) Compile the example.c:

	Step 1:  Copy the directory and its content to a location in the CSL Intelligent Fixed Reader
	Step 2:  Change directory to that location
	Step 3:  type the command "make clean"
	Step 4:  type the command "make"
	
2) After that, an execuation file with the name "example" will be created.

3) You can now use this command with following syntax in that location (for example if you are running a CS463-2 FCC reader):  "./example -conf configCS463_FCC.txt"

4) You can modify the configCS463_FCC.txt file and change the various EPC parameters.
